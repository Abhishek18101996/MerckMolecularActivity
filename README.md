# MerckMolecularActivity

This project aims to predict the biological activity of molecules using machine learning techniques with Merck's provided dataset that includes molecular descriptors and biological activity. The dataset is preprocessed to make it suitable for modeling by handling missing values, converting categorical variables, and feature scaling. Visualization techniques are used to explore the data and identify relationships between features and biological activity. Various machine learning algorithms are employed to create models that predict biological activity, which are then evaluated using performance metrics. The most important features contributing to the prediction of biological activity are identified using feature importance plots created by the Random Forest model.
